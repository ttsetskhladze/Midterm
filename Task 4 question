Diffie–Hellman key exchange is widely used in real-world secure communication systems because it lets two parties safely agree on a shared secret over an insecure network. One major example is the TLS handshake, where modern HTTPS connections use Diffie–Hellman or Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) to create temporary session keys so that web traffic can be encrypted. It is also a foundational part of secure messaging protocols like Signal, where DH-based exchanges enable features such as forward secrecy and the Double Ratchet algorithm. Diffie–Hellman is important because it prevents attackers from deriving the encryption key even if they intercept all traffic; the shared secret is never transmitted and cannot be computed without the private keys. This makes it essential for protecting confidentiality and ensuring secure communication between parties who have never met before.
